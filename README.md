# Site Recording by 500apps - Website Visitor Tracker 
Site recording is a tool that records browsing sessions of website visitors. It enables marketers to understand the entire user journeys on the website as well as how they use your site, allowing you to see everything they do. Examine each mouse movement, scroll, click on your website.
You can use this to identify areas that cause users to leave, identify user frustration and determine if certain elements on your website are confusing the user. This allows you to make more informed decisions, create a better digital experience for your visitors and improve user experience.
